Open matlab and run "main.m"

AIM: 
  Train FFNN for a watershed using different algorithms and compare results.

INPUT:
  Number of neurons on the hidden layer.
  Number of patters to use.
  Choose parameters of the algorithm.

OUTPUT:
  convergence's behavior can be plot using "plot(err_<algorithm>)"
  Trained FFNN is saved on "NN_<algorithm>"
  Outputs and errors of FFNN for patters data can be display using "test(NN_<algorithm>,data)"
  Outputs and errors of FFNN for tested data can be display using "test(NN_<algorithm>,newdata)"
